# Digital Communication System Simulation Using MATLAB

Welcome to the **Digital Communication System Simulation Using MATLAB** repository! This repository houses MATLAB simulations developed for the course EN2074 Communication Systems Engineering. These simulations cover various aspects of digital communication systems, providing practical insights into signal processing, modulation techniques, channel modeling, and more.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find MATLAB scripts that simulate:

- **Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)** modulation and demodulation.
- Pulse shaping using **Sinc** and **Raised Cosine** functions.
- Channel effects including **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)** and multipath propagation.
- Equalization techniques such as **Zero-Forcing (ZF)** equalization.
- Eye diagram analysis for evaluating signal quality.

## Contents

- **Scripts**: MATLAB scripts (.m files) for each simulation task.
- **Documentation**: Detailed comments within each script explain the simulation process and parameters.
- **Results**: Plots and figures generated from the simulations, showcasing signal waveforms, eye diagrams, and performance metrics.

## How to Use

To explore and run the simulations:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Execute the MATLAB scripts of interest (e.g., `Task01.m`, `Task02.m`) to run simulations.
4. View the generated plots and results to understand the behavior of different digital communication system components.
